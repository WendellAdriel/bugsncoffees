    <Introduction>
      <Highlight>Hey there, I'm <a href="https://wendelladriel.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wendell Adriel</a> ðŸ‘‹</Highlight><br />
      I'm a Software Engineer and I've been working with software development since 2009. Besides that, I'm a <Highlight>BIG FAN</Highlight> of tabletop RPG games.
      I play D&D since 2008 as a Dungeon Master and I really love fantasy worlds, that's one of the reasons I love to be a Dungeon Master because
      I can create these worlds.
