    I'm a Software Engineer and I've been working with software development
    since 2009. Besides that, I'm a <Highlight>BIG FAN</Highlight> of tabletop
    RPG games. I play D&D since 2008 as a Dungeon Master and I really love
    fantasy worlds, that's one of the reasons I love to be a Dungeon Master
    because I can create these worlds.
